            <h1>If after "The Twelve Days of Christmas" the presents kept coming, would we end up with -1/12 presents?</h1>
            <p>Most of us know the song, but for those who don't, let me summarize it in a mathematician's style: "On the <i><span class="mathmode">1</span></i>st day of Christmas my true love gave to me a partridge in a pear tree. Then, for <i><span class="mathmode">2 ≤ n ≤ 12</span></i>: On the <i><span class="mathmode">n</span></i>th day of Christmas my true love gave to me the same things as on the previous day, plus <i><span class="mathmode">n</span></i> of <i>something</i> (very often a bird of some sort)."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="blog-konigsberg-img1">

        </div>
    
        <div class="teaching-col">
            <p>So on the twelfth day of Christmas, how many Christmas presents did we get? Hopefully you'll agree that would be <i><span class="mathmode">1 + 2 + ... + 11 + 12</span></i>. If you're a physicist, you've probably already taken out your calculator by now, but if you're a mathematician, you likely suspect there's a better way. You're right!</p>
            
            <p>In elementary school, Karl Friedrich Gauss and his classmates were asked by their teacher to add up all the integers (whole numbers) from <i><span class="mathmode">1</span></i> to <i><span class="mathmode">100</span></i>. The teacher, surely thinking he had bought himself a few hours, was astounded to find Gauss almost immediately find the answer: <i><span class="mathmode">5050</span></i>! So how did he do this? The number we're looking for is <i><span class="mathmode">1 + 2 + ... + 99 + 100</span></i>. Let's call it <i><span class="mathmode">S</span></i> for "sum". Let's do a bit of mathematical gymnastics. <i><span class="mathmode">S</span></i> might seem tedious to calculate, so let's calculate <i><span class="mathmode">2S</span></i> instead. <i><span class="mathmode">2S</span></i> is simply <i><span class="mathmode">(100&nbsp;+&nbsp;99&nbsp;+&nbsp;...&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;+&nbsp;1) + (1&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;+&nbsp;...&nbsp;+&nbsp;99&nbsp;+&nbsp;100)</span></i> We can rearrange this as <i><span class="mathmode">(1&nbsp;+&nbsp;100) + (2&nbsp;+&nbsp;99) + ... + (99&nbsp;+&nbsp;2) + (100&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)</span></i>. Take a second to convince yourself that this is equal to <i><span class="mathmode">50×101</span></i>, which in turn is equal to <i><span class="mathmode">5050</span></i>!</p>

            <p>Upon me was once in my undergraduate years imparted a piece of valuable advice: "be wise, generalize!" After all, how else could we apply this to our festive problem? So let's take what we've learned and make a theorem out of it. Instead of taking the sum of natural numbers from <i><span class="mathmode">1</span></i> to <i><span class="mathmode">100</span></i>, let's take the sum of natural numbers from <i><span class="mathmode">1</span></i> to <i><span class="mathmode">n</span></i>. Let's replace <i><span class="mathmode">100</span></i> with <i><span class="mathmode">n</span></i> in our above equation and obtain <i><span class="mathmode">1&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;+&nbsp;...&nbsp;+&nbsp;n = (n/2)(n&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)</span></i>.</p>
            
            <p>Finally, we can calculate how many presents we've received after the twelfth day of Christmas. Using the formula <i><span class="mathmode">1&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;+&nbsp;...&nbsp;+&nbsp;n = (n/2)(n&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)</span></i> and replacing <i><span class="mathmode">n</span></i> with <i><span class="mathmode">12</span></i>, we get a total of <i><span class="mathmode">(12/2)(12&nbsp;+&nbsp;1) = 78</span></i>. There you have it! On the twelvth day of Christmas my true love gave to me <i><span class="mathmode">(12/2)(12&nbsp;+&nbsp;1) = 78</span></i> presents.</p>
            
            <p>I could end this post here, but that would leave out the folly of the following claim: <i><span class="mathmode">1 + 2 + 3 + ... = -1/12</span></i>. This has been claimed by such sources as the popular YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@numberphile">Numberphile</a>. But I know what you're thinking: "Max, that's ridiculous. Clearly the sum should be infinite. How could a sum of positive numbers be negative? How could a sum of integers be a non-integer?" Your worries are valid. In fact, I agree with you. Let's destroy their reasoning together.</p>
            
            <p>The argument starts with the claim that <i><span class="mathmode">1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - ... = ½</span></i>. If your instinct is telling you this looks wrong, you're right! But let's give them the benefit of the doubt and look at the proof. I want you to spot the mistake. Let's call this sum <i><span class="mathmode">X</span></i>. Now let's compute <i><span class="mathmode">1 - X</span></i>. We have</p>
            
            <p style="text-align: center"><i><span class="mathmode">1 - X = 1 - (1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - ...)</span></i></p>
            
            <p>It follows that</p>
            
            <p style="text-align: center"><i><span class="mathmode">1 - X = X</span></i></p>
            <p>Therefore <i><span class="mathmode">X = ½</span></i>. So did you find the mistake? Well here it is: We've been treating <i><span class="mathmode">1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - ...</span></i> as a real number! We called it <i><span class="mathmode">X</span></i> and assumed we could perform arithmetic on it. We can't. A sum like this with infinitely many terms is called a <i>series</i>. Roughly speaking, we call a series <i>convergent</i> if its total is a real number. For instance, the series <i><span class="mathmode">½ + ¼ + ⅛ + ...</span></i> converges to 1. Intuitively, we can think of this sum as one in which the total slowly gets closer to <i><span class="mathmode">1</span></i> as we add more terms. When a series is not convergent, it's said to be <i>divergent</i>. This is the case for <i><span class="mathmode">1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - ...</span></i>, as no matter how many terms we add, the total just alternates between <i><span class="mathmode">0</span></i> and <i><span class="mathmode">1</span></i>. That is, it never approaches a real number. Since the sum is not a real number, we can't just assume we can apply arithmetic opperations to it. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-I6XTVZXww">the Numberphile video</a>, they commit the same mathematical crime with the series <i><span class="mathmode">1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + ...</span></i>.</p>
            
            <p><i><span class="mathmode">1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ...</span></i>, as you may have noticed, does not approach a real number value. It continues to grow and grow. It is, in fact, divergent.</p>
            
            <p>Now you're all set for the holidays. In case there's an awkward silence during your family's Christmas dinner, you'll have something to break it.</p>
